Instructions to get MovingPapa working
--------------------------------------

First, you'll need Visual Studio 2022 installed along with ASP.NET Core.

Then, set up the database. You'll need Docker for this.

You can use run.bat once you have Docker installed.

Once you have run that, go to http://localhost:16000 and create a database called MovingPapa.

Then copy and paste the sql from run_this_to_create_database.sql into the SQL runner and the tables will be populated.

From there, you can use Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio and it should run the Moving Papa website.
